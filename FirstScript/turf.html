<!-- 
 Hello and welcome to a new geoprogramming video. this time we will learn about how to use the amazing package of turf in js. Turf allows you to 
 perform geospatial calculations on your web app.

 I strongly recommend you to watch first the leaflet in js video, as we will use leaflet to visualize the turf calculations.

 Wi will start by creating a file .html like this one and creatting the basic html structure . Second step will be to add the leaflet and turf
 libraries (you can copy them from the file -remember it is always in the description box).


 To set up a map with leaflet, we also need to create a div with an id, that we will use to add the code later. first we need to add the style to
 be able to visualize it. And then, to create the div

 Now we can start with the script

// we set up the map and the setview with leaflet

var map = L.map('map').setView([36.9660, -5.6616], 15);

// and then we add the map

L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        maxZoom: 19,
        attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
        }).addTo(map);

// this was leaflet, now let's start with turf

// the first step will be to create a collection of points, we do so by using turf.points

var pointsCollection = turf.points([
                    [-5.6664, 36.9669],
					[-5.6616, 36.9660],
					[-5.6611, 36.9637],
					[-5.6659, 36.9641]
        ]);

// if you realize, the lat long are switched if you take leaflet as reference, will not affect in this case as we will use turf as a geojson object
// but it is good for you to know

// to add it to the map as geojson object, you have to write the following

L.geoJson(pointsCollection).addTo(map);

// now, let's calculate the center of those 4 points

var center = turf.center(pointsCollection);

L.geoJSON(center).addTo(map);

// and now we have a new point in the center

// another thing we can do is to calculate the distance between two points
// imagine that we wanna calculate the distance between 1st and second point
// we are going to access to the leaflet object to get those points
// would be working as well with turf.points(and here you add the coords within a [])
// if you wanna see how to access an object, you can check it by console.log(pointsCollection)

var distance = turf.distance(pointsCollection.features[0], pointsCollection.features[1]);
// alert("distance between points in km: " + distance)

// we can as well calculate a middle point between two points with the following

var midpoint = turf.midpoint(pointsCollection.features[0], pointsCollection.features[1]);

L.geoJSON(midpoint).addTo(map);


// but it is not only points, turf can also work with polygons
// so, how to create a polygon now with the points from the pointsCollection?
// the easiest way is this one, copy the coords and add the first coord at the end to close the polygon

var polygon = turf.polygon([[
                    [-5.6664, 36.9669],
					[-5.6616, 36.9660],
					[-5.6611, 36.9637],
					[-5.6659, 36.9641],
                    [-5.6664, 36.9669]
]])

L.geoJSON(polygon).addTo(map);

// pretty awesome right??

// wait
// first, let's calculate the area of the polygon

var area = turf.area(polygon);
// alert("the area in m2 is: " + area)

// co co cool, 

// to finalize this, let's create a new poligon and calculate the interection between both
// will change the color of the new polygons to differenciate them

var polygon_two = turf.polygon([[
                    [-3.6664, 39.9669],
					[-5.6616, 36.9660],
					[-6.6611, 35.9637],
					[-5.6659, 36.9641],
                    [-3.6664, 39.9669]
        ]]);

L.geoJSON(polygon_two, {style: {'color': 'red'}}).addTo(map);

var intersection = turf.intersect(polygon, polygon_two);

L.geoJSON(intersection, {style: {'color': 'green'}}).addTo(map);


// there it is. that was all for today, there are many many funcionallities more in turf, if you enjoy this video I will make annother
// one with more of them. byeee
